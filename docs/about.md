### About this Blog

Since Jan 2015, Iâ€™ve spent about half-year in learning data science. Having explored multiple online courses, quora threads, websites, textbooks, I was toddling around in a sea of new things. The primary motivation of this blog to track the learning journey and to summarize all those useful stuffs I found, so that to put everything in a more structured way.   

I believe the best way to learn is to teach and to share. Hope this blog may help someone, who is also learning data science,  in any sense.
