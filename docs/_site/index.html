      <div class="entry">
        <p>This time I am going to continue with the kaggle 101 level competition – <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer">digit recogniser</a> with deep learning tool Tensor Flow. <br />
In the <a href="https://6chaoran.github.io/DataStory/kaggle-digit-recogition/">previous post</a>, I used PCA and Pooling methods to reduce the dimensions of the dataset, and train with the linear SVM. Due to the limited efficiency of the R SVM package. I only sampled 500 records and performed a 10-fold cross validation. The resulting accuracy is about 82.7%</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>The most straight forward recommendation system are either user based CF (collaborative filtering) or item based CF, which are categorized as memory based methods. User-Based CF is to recommend products based on behaviour of similar users, and the Item-Based CF is to recommend similar products from products that user purchased. No matter which method is used, the user-user or item-item similarity matrix, which could be sizable, is required to compute.</p>

        <p>Continued with <a href="https://6chaoran.github.io/DataStory/job-hunting-web-scraping/">previous post</a>, I’ve added some additional lines of codes to fetch the job description of each job post. This will take a bit longer time, which is about (1.5 hour) for me, because I set a delay of ~10 seconds between each request. <br />
This week I will continue with overview picture of the job market of Data Analyst and develop a simple recommender based on skill and experience requirement.</p>

<p>I’m currently suffering a tough time in looking for a data analyst job.<br />
Instead of doing it in a traditional way, I am thinking why not do the job hunting just like a data analyst, by making use of the advantages of data science.</p>

        <h2 id="intro-to-tableau">Intro to Tableau</h2>
<p>Aspired by the course ‘Data Visualization’ offered by University of Illinois on Cousera, I have worked on the interactive data visualization using Tableau. There is a free version of <a href="https://public.tableau.com/s/">Tableau Public</a> is available and you can upload the visualization online for sharing.  <br />
Tableau is one of the Business Intelligence tools that makes it easier to do with aesthetic chart plotting and interactive report generating. There are 3 main components used in Tableau: Worksheet, Dashboard and Story.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Worksheets</strong> are single chart or plot</li>
  <li><strong>Dashboard</strong> is a single page can compose with mupliple charts or plots</li>
  <li><strong>Story</strong> is like powerpoint in MS Office, which put a series of pages of charts in sequence.</li>
</ul>

        <p>This time I am going to demostrate the kaggle 101 level competition - <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer" target="_blank">digit recogniser</a>. We are asked to train a model to recogize the digit from the pixel data in this competition. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data" target="_blank">The data set</a> is available here.
description of the data:</p>
<ol>
  <li>label: the integers from 0 - 9;</li>
  <li>features: pixel001-pixel784, which are rolled out from 28x28 digit image;</li>
  <li>pixel data is ranged from 0 -255, which indicating the brightness of the pixel in grey scale;</li>
</ol>
<h2>Visualize the digit:</h2>
<p>Let’s randomly look at 100 digit examples:</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggmap/index.html">ggmap</a>, which is an R package built to visualize with map, is very similar to <a href="http://ggplot2.org/">ggplot2</a>. And its output is ‘ggplot’ class, which means it also support layered visualization just like ggplot2. I will demonstrate with two examples “<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime/data">Crimes in San Fransisco</a>” and “<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/pkdd-15-predict-taxi-service-trajectory-i/data">Taxi in Porto</a>”. The data of both examples are taken from kaggle.</p>
